# Temp_converter
This project was made to read in temps in C and traslate them into F and output them to a new file. What I feel I did really well was only stroing one value at a time to decrease ram size, this also alows me to take in any number of inputs and output them in real time. The thing I feel I could have improved was formating the output file to make it look nicer and maybe have the origianal values as well. The most challenging parts was not having the predefined classes I would have had in Java, so I just recreated them manully. I made this maintanable with comments and well named functions, and it is adaptable sice it can pull any amount of temps and not a predefined number.
